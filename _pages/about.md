**Difflare: Removing Image Lens Flare with Latent Diffusion Models**  
**Tianwen Zhou**, Qihao Duan and Zitong Yu*.

**<font color = "#224B8D">BMVC 2024 (Core A)</font>** \| [Paper](https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_437/paper.pdf) \| [Code](https://github.com/TianwenZhou/Difflare) \| [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naYsWT7SOn0)  <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='3WQTKocAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC'></span></strong>
- This work presents a novel paradigm for image lens flare removal.
- We utilize both the physics prior of lens flare and the prior encapsulated in pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDM).
